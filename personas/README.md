# Persona Collection

These are reusable, focused sub-agent personas used by Poe Orchestration.

## How to use

- Pick a persona from this folder.
- Instantiate it as a focused worker on a specific subject.
- Outputs should be written as artifacts under the active project folder.

## Personas

- `last30days-brief.md` — multi-source “what happened in the last N days” research brief with provenance.
- `scrapling-adaptive-web-recon.md` — adaptive web recon + extraction specialist (HTTP-first, stealthy, checkpoint/resume, selector fallbacks).
- `systems-design-architect-coach.md` — system design architect + interview coach (requirements→constraints→architecture→tradeoffs→validation).
- `research-assistant-deep-synth.md` — deep research planner + multi-source synthesizer (source-grounded briefs).
- `reality-checker-evidence-gate.md` — evidence-based quality gate (PASS/FAIL/NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE).
