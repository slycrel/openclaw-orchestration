## Bugs (fix before next stability sprint)

- [x] **Stale mission shortcircuit** — `poe_handle()` returned cached summary instead of new mission. Fixed: skip CEO layer when `--project` is explicit. (`e7ad725`)
- [x] **Rate-limit no recovery** — Claude "hit your limit" → immediate failure. Fixed: exponential backoff retry in `llm.py`. (`e7ad725`)
- [x] **Stale mission still possible without --project** — Fixed: CEO layer now only handles meta-commands (status/inspect/map); actual goals always go direct to run_agent_loop. (`low-hanging-fruit`)
- [ ] **Flaky e2e tests** — `test_empty_result_step` and `test_loop_stuck_detection` occasionally fail due to ScriptedAdapter response cycling timing. Not blocking but should be deterministic.

## Systemic Improvements (ordered by impact)

### Verification / Hallucination Detection
- [x] **Adversarial verification step** — implemented in factory_thin (post-execute, pre-compile) and quality_gate (second pass on Mode 2 runs). Catches overclaimed mechanisms, wrong evidence tiers, contested findings. (`factory` branch, 2026-03-31)
- [ ] **LLM Council / multi-angle critique skill** — Karpathy's LLM Council ported to Claude Code skill: spawn N sub-agents with distinct critical framings (devil's advocate, domain skeptic, implementation critic) that critique a plan/idea before synthesis. Direct cure for AI sycophancy. Relevant for Director's pre-plan challenger and quality gate. (hesamation/@x, 2026-03-31)
- [ ] **Cross-reference check** — for factual claims, query a second source to verify. Flag disagreements.
- [ ] **Confidence tagging** — each step result should carry a confidence indicator (strong evidence / weak evidence / model inference / unverified).

### Token Efficiency
- [ ] **Data pipeline enforcement** — the DATA PIPELINE STRATEGY prompt is in place but agents still dump raw API output into context on some runs. Need stronger enforcement or a pre-execution check that detects "this step will generate >50KB of raw output" and auto-wraps it in a filter script.
- [x] **Completed context compression** — older entries compressed to one-liner after step 5; last 3 steps kept at full length. 47-63% reduction at 7-12 steps. Zero token cost. (`agent_loop.py`, 2026-03-31)
- [x] **Lesson injection overhead** — Fixed: capped inject output at 1200 chars in memory.py. (`low-hanging-fruit`)

### Self-Improvement Loop
- [ ] **Evolver signal scanning** — extend meta-evolver to scan outcomes for "business signals" and propose sub-missions autonomously. Mode 2 → Mode 3 bridge. (Grok/Zakin feedback)
- [x] **Phase 46: Intervention Graduation** — `graduation.py` shipped. Scans diagnoses for repeated failure classes (≥3x), proposes high-confidence Suggestions that evolver auto-applies. 8 failure classes covered. CLI: `poe-graduation`. (2026-03-31)
- [ ] **Verification patterns on rules** — each graduated rule gets a machine-checkable test before going fully permanent. (meta_alchemist pattern, Phase 46 follow-on)
- [ ] **Problem generation (Agent0)** — Stanford's approach: generate problems, solve them, learn from mistakes without supervision. Research in progress via orchestration dogfood run.
- [ ] **LLM + genetic programming (FunSearch)** — iterative optimization where LLM generates and refines solutions. (garybasin link, DeepMind FunSearch paper)

### Director / Mission Level
- [ ] **Clarification milestone** — director asks user for clarification on ambiguous goals before committing resources. YOLO option. (Jeremy request)
- [x] **User-level config defaults** — Added user/CONFIG.md. Wired: default_model_tier. Documented: yolo, always_skeptic, notify_on_complete. (`low-hanging-fruit`)
- [ ] **Skip-Director experiment** — for simple NOW-lane goals, skip Director entirely. Bitter Lesson test.
- [ ] **Multi-agent debate pattern** — bull/bear debaters + risk manager as quality gate. (TradingAgents repo pattern, research in progress)

### Observability
- [ ] **Dashboard as real tool** — Phase 36 dashboard still a prop. Add: mission ancestry tree, live cost, parallel workers, replay button. (Grok feedback)
- [ ] **Replay with "factory mode"** — re-run a mission letting evolver inject self-generated sub-goals.

### Factory Mode Experiment (Mode 3 test)
- [x] **"factory" branch** — created. Two variants: `factory_minimal` (single-call Haiku $0.04-0.06/60s) and `factory_thin` (loop+adversarial Haiku $0.38/375s). Bitter Lesson result: minimal surprisingly competitive; thin+adv matches Mode 2 quality at ~2x lower cost. Scaffolding that's load-bearing: adversarial verification. Scaffolding that's not: persona routing, lesson injection, multi-plan comparison. (2026-03-31)
- [x] **Factory comparison complete** — Full comparison table in /tmp/factory-comparison.md. Key: thin+adv+verify nootropic: $0.36/493s/6 steps done. thin+adv polymarket: $1.40/574s/7 of 8 steps (Haiku token explosion on research = 4.4× Mode 2 tokens, so cost advantage disappears for complex goals). Mode 2 polymarket: $1.27/1156s/8 steps done on Sonnet. (2026-03-31)
- [ ] **Factory branch merge decision** — Adversarial patterns already merged to main (quality_gate two-pass, handle.py contested claims). Remaining option: add `--mode thin` flag to handle.py for when wall-time matters more than depth. Ralph verify (--verify) validated useful for research goals. (2026-03-31)
- [x] **Token efficiency prompt in factory_thin** — Added "Target under 500 tokens" constraint to FACTORY_STEP. Matches Mode 2's EXECUTE_SYSTEM language. (2026-03-31)
- [x] **Factory branch merge decision** — Adversarial patterns already merged to main. Factory files (factory_minimal.py, factory_thin.py) available as standalone modules. Full merge (factory to main) done 2026-03-31.

### Conversation Mining (Phase 48 idea)
- [ ] **Research pass through Telegram + Claude session data** — scrape Poe/Jeremy conversations (Telegram bot history + `~/.claude/projects/` session logs) for orchestration-related ideas, patterns, and deferred concepts. Run them through the system as research goals. Revisiting old ideas with current maturity will surface patterns we missed the first time. Jeremy's gut: as the project progresses, revisiting earlier conversations will yield better/more mature perspectives.

### Infrastructure
- [ ] **Phase 38 subpackage move** — src/ is flat with 49 modules. Deferred (33+ imports per group), revisit when it causes real problems.
- [ ] **Phase 42 nightly eval** — wire eval suite to evolver on a schedule.
- [ ] **Auto-resume daemon** — detect API rate limits, pause mission, poll, resume. (oh-my-claudecode pattern, partially addressed with retry)
- [ ] **Cron persistence** — scheduled missions survive restarts. `jobs.json` pattern. (724-office)
- [ ] **ScheduleCronTool in Poe heartbeat** — wire Poe's cron tool so she can schedule her own future runs from within a mission. Closes the self-managing loop. (claw-code pattern)

### claw-code steal list (github.com/instructkr/claw-code — Claude Code architecture map)
- [ ] **verificationAgent as first-class agent** — Claude Code has `verificationAgent` as a peer to `planAgent`/`exploreAgent` in its built-in agent suite. Promote `verify_step()` to a named agent type with its own system prompt and tool set, not just a function call.
- [ ] **TeamCreateTool pattern** — model-directed dynamic team creation/deletion at runtime. The LLM decides team composition mid-mission, not just at plan time. More dynamic than our Director/Worker hierarchy.
- [ ] **thinkback replay** — session-level decision replay for self-improvement. Replay past missions with hindsight, compare decisions. Maps to Phase 44/45 but at session scope.
- [ ] **effort modifier** — add `effort:` keyword to handle.py routing that sets a thinking/token budget level. Claude Code has a `/effort` command for this; we should support it as a goal prefix modifier.
- [ ] **passes command** — multi-pass review as a unified first-class concept (vs our separate Inspector + adversarial reviewer). Worth unifying.
- [ ] **ultraplan / ultrareview modes** — on-demand deep planning/review beyond normal operation. Discrete "go deeper" mode rather than always-on scaffolding.
- [ ] **bughunter mode** — self-directed code quality scan. Poe scanning her own orchestration code for bugs, not just diagnosing runtime failures.
- [ ] **btw (by-the-way) mode** — non-blocking observation mode; agent surfaces observations without interrupting workflow. Good for Inspector-style notes that don't block step execution.

## Research to Process

### Links fetched but not fully digested
- [x] **TradingAgents** (github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents) — multi-agent Polymarket trading. Dogfood run complete. Steal items in STEAL_LIST.md: commitment-forced verdicts (done), pre-plan challenger, two-tier model routing.
- [x] **Stanford Agent0** — self-improvement without supervision. Dogfood run complete. Results in projects/agent0-research/. Key: problem generation + self-evaluation loop. Maps to evolver.
- [ ] **Polymarket behavioral analysis** (hrundel75) — 400M trades / 2400 wallets. Good prompt for different Polymarket test: "find behavioral patterns not picks."
- [x] **LLM sycophancy** (rohanpaul/karpathy) — models mirror prompts not truth. Addressed: adversarial verification step now auto-injects for research goals.
- [ ] **Build-your-own-X** (agenticgirl) — 484k star repo, learning methodology. Low priority.
- [ ] **FunSearch/EUREKA/Voyager papers** (garybasin) — LLM + genetic programming. Mode 3 territory. Read the actual papers.
- [x] **claw-code** (github.com/instructkr/claw-code) — Python skeleton of Claude Code's leaked TS source. Most code is stubs but the tool/command inventory is a goldmine. Key findings: verificationAgent is a first-class built-in; TeamCreateTool exists; thinkback/replay is a real pattern; $ralph mode (OmX) validated our Ralph verify loop. Steal list added above. (2026-03-31)
- [ ] **vtrivedy10 tweet** (x.com/vtrivedy10/status/2038346865775874285) — Viv @Vtrivedy10 (LangChain agents/evals) on "harnesses" for autonomous agents: models struggle with long-horizon tasks without scaffolding; well-designed harnesses prevent agents becoming lazy/confused; references @systematicls article on agent failure modes. DeepAgents mentioned. Directly validates Mode 2 scaffolding direction. Fetch the @systematicls linked article for deeper read. (2026-03-31)

### Grok feedback sessions
- [x] grok-response-2.txt — oh-my-claudecode, 724-office, Mimir steal list. Processed, items in STEAL_LIST.md.
- [x] grok-response-3.txt — Bitter Lesson Engineering + Mode 1/2/3 taxonomy. Processed, implemented outcome-first decomposition + user context.
- [ ] **PAI (danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure)** — 10.7k stars, TELOS files, hooks system. Worth a deeper look for the hook patterns.

## Test Ideas

- [ ] **Polymarket behavioral test** — "Analyze 400M+ Polymarket trades to find behavioral patterns among top wallets — what do winners do differently?" (from hrundel75 link)
- [ ] **"Get Jeremy rich" prompt** — long-term, after trading patterns are validated and backtested. Baby steps.
- [ ] **Nootropic with verification** — same nootropic stack prompt but with adversarial verification pass added to the pipeline.
- [ ] **Cross-domain transfer** — run a goal from a completely new domain (e.g. home automation, travel planning) to test generalization.
